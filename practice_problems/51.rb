# The following is a short description of an application that lets a customer place an order for a meal:
# - A meal always has three meal items: a burger, a side, and drink.
# - For each meal item, the customer must choose an option.
# - The application must compute the total cost of the order.

# 1. Identify the nouns and verbs we need in order to model our classes and methods.
# 2. Create an outline in code (a spike) of the structure of this application.
# 3. Place methods in the appropriate classes to correspond with various verbs.
