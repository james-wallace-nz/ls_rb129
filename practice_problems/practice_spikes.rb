### Preschool (by Natalie Thompson)

# Inside a preschool there are children, teachers, class assistants, a principle, janitors, and cafeteria workers. Both teachers and assistants can help a student with schoolwork and watch them on the playground. A teacher teaches and an assistant helps kids with any bathroom emergencies. Kids themselves can learn and play. A teacher and principle can supervise a class. Only the principle has the ability to expel a kid. Janitors have the ability to clean. Cafeteria workers have the ability to serve food. Children, teachers, class assistants, principles, janitors and cafeteria workers all have the ability to eat lunch.
