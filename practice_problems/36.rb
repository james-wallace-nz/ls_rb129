# What is the relationship between classes and objects in Ruby?

# Classes define the template for objects, which are instances of the class. A class may also have its own class methods and class variables.

# Objects are instances of a class and have instance variables that may be different to other instances of the same class. All instances of a class have the same behaviour determined by the instance methods defined in the class definition.
