# When should we use class inheritance versus interface inheritance?

# We should use class inheritance where there is a logical hierarchy of parent classes down to sub-classes. We should use interface inheritance (mixin modules) when there is no clear hierarchy but we want to reuse the same code in multiple places rather than writing it repetitively.
